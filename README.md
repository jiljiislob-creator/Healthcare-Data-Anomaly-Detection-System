# Healthcare Data Anomaly Detection System

## Project Overview
This project develops a sophisticated anomaly detection system for healthcare datasets. It applies advanced machine learning techniques to identify unusual patterns in patient records and medical imaging, aiding in early diagnosis and ensuring data integrity.

## Features
- Anomaly detection in healthcare time-series data.
- CNN-based anomaly detection in medical images.
- Visualization tools for identified anomalies.

## Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow
- OpenCV for image processing
- Pandas, NumPy for data handling
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

## Getting Started
- Install required packages: `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow opencv-python`.
- Run `enhanced_healthcare_anomaly_detection.py`.

## Usage
- The script includes functions for processing healthcare data, training ML models, and detecting anomalies.
- Modify the script to point to your specific datasets.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the range of detectable anomalies in diverse datasets.
- Integrate real-time data analysis capabilities.
- Develop a more interactive and user-friendly interface for data exploration.
